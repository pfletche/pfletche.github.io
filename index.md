## **Paul** Fletcher

I'm a Masters Degree student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). I also work as a research assistant at the [Nebraska Intelligent Mobile Unmanned Systems (NIMBUS) Lab](https://nimbus.unl.edu/). 

My work focuses on developing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that collect better data to inform science decision making and create safer human interactions. I am currently researching methods to collect CO2 and H20 data from rainforest canopies in Costa Rica with UAVs. 

I'm also a volunteer Master Naturalist with the state of Nebraska where I contribute to local conservation, environmental education, and citizen science projects.
