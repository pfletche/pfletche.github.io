## **Paul** Fletcher

I'm a Masters Degree students in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). I also work as a research assistant at the Nebraska Intelligent Mobile Unmanned Systems (NIMBUS) Lab. 

My work focuses on developing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that collect better data to inform science decision making and create safer human interactions. I am currently researching methods to collect CO2 and H20 data from rainforest canopies in Costa Rica with UAVs. 

I'm also a volunteer Master Naturalist with the state of Nebraska where I contribute to local conservation, environmental education, and citizen science projects.
